// codicological codicological_units
- the above
- the tiny insert
- the change in hand which contains a service as well as the names of the deceased monks
- perhaps the arabic note?
- the Arabic on the pastedowns?

// textual artifacts

- the Services
  - list out the various hymns, prayers, etc. as a TOC?
- the other Service according to the Syriac
- in another codicological unit you have the nbames of the deceased at the monastery
  - same unit you have another service for the deceased
- returnign to the same hand (so original unit?) you have another Service
- the colophon (not an item, but note it on f. 62v)
- an arabic note that is maybe just a colophon?
- another hymn for the deceased
- another service follows (maybe a post-burial? 65v)
  - this goes onto 66v and that's the end.

- calligraphic practice maybe on the fly-leaves in Arabic, but need to look more closely
